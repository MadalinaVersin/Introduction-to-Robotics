Laboratory homeworks

In Laboratory_2.ino I made a project to connect an RGB to 3 potentiometers.


Laboratory__3.ino- In this project I used  a passive buzzer for knock detection ,an  active buzzer for sound and a pushbutton. When
                   the pasive buzzer detects a knock , the active buzzer starts to sing and by pressing  the button it stops .
