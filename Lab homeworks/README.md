Laboratory homeworks

Laboratory_2.ino - I made a project to connect an RGB to 3 potentiometers.


Laboratory_3.ino - In this project I used  a passive buzzer for knock detection ,an  active buzzer for sound and a pushbutton. When
                   the pasive buzzer detects a knock , the active buzzer starts to sing and by pressing  the button it stops .

Laboratory_3_adjusted.ino -I made some changes to Laboratory_3.ino.
