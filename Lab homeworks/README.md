<h1><b>Laboratory homeworks</b><h1>

<h4>Laboratory_2.ino </h4>- I made a project to connect an RGB to 3 potentiometers.


<h4>Laboratory_3.ino</h4> - In this project I used  a passive buzzer for knock detection ,an  active buzzer for sound and a pushbutton. When
                   the pasive buzzer detects a knock , the active buzzer starts to sing and by pressing  the button it stops .

<h4>Laboratory_3_adjusted.ino</h4>-I made some changes to Laboratory_3.ino.

<h4>Laboratory_4.ino </h4>- In this project I used a joystick and a 4 digit 7-segment display. I used the joystick to control each digit of the                     segment. The X-axis cycle through the digits and choose which one to modify (light up the DP led of the current position).                 When  pressed the button, locks the digit to be set, the Y-axis modifies the value of the digit. Press the button again to                 unlock the selection and be able to cycle through the 4 digits again.

<h4>Laboratory_5.ino</h4> - In this project I used a LCD and a joystick. I made a game menu.
